            <h2>Biography</h2>
            <p>
                I'm Michael Ukpong, a passionate tech enthusiast with a
                background
                in frontend development. Over the past few years, I’ve been
                building
                clean, responsive, and user-friendly web interfaces using React
                and
                TypeScript. My interest in tech started with a strong desire to
                solve everyday problems through technology, and that curiosity
                quickly turned into a deep commitment to software development.
            </p>
            <p>As I grew in the field, I realized the importance of
                understanding
                not just the frontend, but how complete systems work. This has
                driven me to expand my knowledge beyond the UI layer and explore
                areas like cloud computing and DevOps. I’m constantly learning,
                improving, and looking for ways to build better, more scalable
                solutions.</p>

            <h2>Why I Joined AltSchool</h2>
            <p>
                I joined AltSchool to get a more structured and comprehensive
                understanding of Cloud Engineering. While I have learned a lot
                through
                self-teaching, I want to deepen my technical foundation, learn
                best
                practices, and get mentorship from professionals. AltSchool
                offers a
                unique opportunity to grow through hands-on projects and
                community
                support. I also want to build that community of like minds that
                are
                also in the cloud computing field and AltSchool offers this too.
            </p>
